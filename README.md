# Evaluating a Pure Planning Approach to User Provided Context
Modelling additional user context and quantifiying if and how PRP++ to handle this for CISC 813 Course Project

This repo contains:
 - a *domain folder* with 3 domain files for basic, some, and everything in terms of the amount of context allowed. 
 - a *problem folder* with 8 problem files for varying levels of context.

This summarizes the different domain and problem file combinations for different levels of additional user context. This table can also be found in the Evaluation section of the report 

| Amount of Context |          Domain        |     Problem    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
| (0) None          | domain-basic.pddl      | problem-0.pddl |
| l level           | domain-some.pddl       | problem-1.pddl |
| 2 levels          | domain-some.pddl       | problem-2.pddl |
| 3 levels          | domain-some.pddl       | problem-3.pddl |
| 4 levels          | domain-some.pddl       | problem-4.pddl |
